                        <p>Escape the Ordinary! started with two simple discoveries our founders made while building their first company, which made burgers and sandwiches for restaurants. That original business gave the partners kitchen-door access to top chefs and managers at hundreds of restaurants. And, it gave them the chance to confirm what they suspected all along. First, that's really hard to find great burgers. And, the burgers have powerful intangible qualities that elicit feelings of comfort, warmth and well-being for many people.</p>

                                    <p>1997- Inspired by their discoveries and passion for burgers and sandwiches, the founders sold their original business, teamed up with a top chef and spent almost two years creating and evaluating recipes. After a painstaking trial-and-error process and hundreds of group tastings, they were ready to introduce their proprietary business known as Eatery.</p>
                                <p>1998- The founders opened the first Escape the Ordinary! restaurant in Gurgaon, India and confirmed what they suspected all along — that there was a strong demand for the kind of authentic Burgers that people love, but seldom have time to prepare.</p>
                                
                                <p>1999-2000- The company continued to fine-tune its burgers and added made-to-order salads and sandwiches to the menu. It also opened in five more areas.</p>
                               <p>2003-2007- Escape the Ordinary‘s first franchise location opened in Gurgaon, India and the company began building a support team and cultural foundation for a growing franchise system. In 2007, Richard Simtob, respected franchise executive and entrepreneur, joined Escape the Ordinary! to guide its continued franchise growth</p>
                            <p>2008-2018- Through the hard work of its many committed franchise partners and team members, we continued to open restaurants in India and Mumbai.</p>
